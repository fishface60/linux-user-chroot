Import read only system
-----------------------

I'd like to make it easy to capture just /usr from the host, without
e.g. /home or any other network mounts.  Probably the easiest way to
do this is `--tmpfs-root` or something, and have that auto-create
mount points for `/dev` etc.  Then one could `--mount-bind /usr /usr`.

 - Look at what Chromium/ChromeOS are doing?

Avoid creating any files as root/share tmpfs
--------------------------------------------

We're creating device nodes owned by root, which means
quota is counted against root.  Can we share a tmpfs
that we create as non-root, and ensure every file we
make is owned by the target uid?
